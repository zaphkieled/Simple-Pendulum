# Simple Pendulum
Hi!, this is my final project for the course of Classical Mechanics and I decided to upload it here in case anyone would need it or something similar.

The code uses a numerical method called Differential Numeration that basically uses certain terms of the Taylor series depending on the order of the derivative you need to use. This is deeply explained in the jupyter notebook using the ODE of a simple pendulum and two approximations. 

Also you can modify my code for solving any other ODE of 2nd order or you can use it as a guide to change the order of the ODE.
If you still have another doubt you can dm at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zaphkieled).
